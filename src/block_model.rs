/// Block model geometry with optional sub-blocks.
///
/// First, the `orient` field defines the position and orientation of a (U, V, W) space relative
/// to the project, which could be just an offset or a full rotation as well. Then the `grid`
/// field defines the size and number of parent blocks aligned with that space and starting at
/// (0, 0, 0). [Sub-blocks](crate::Subblocks) can then optionally be added inside those parent
/// blocks using a variety of layouts.
///
/// While sub-blocks are supported on tensor grids it isn't a common arrangement and many
/// applications won't load them.
///
/// ### Attribute Locations
///
/// - [`Vertices`](crate::Location::Vertices) puts attribute values on the corners of the
///   parent blocks. If the block count is $(N_0, N_1, N_2)$ then there must be
///   $(N_0 + 1) 路 (N_1 + 1) 路 (N_2 + 1)$ values. Ordering increases U first, then V, then W.
///
/// - [`Blocks`](crate::Location::Primitives) puts attribute values on the centroids of the
///   parent block. If the block count is $(N_0, N_1, N_2)$ then there must be
///   $N_0 路 N_1 路 N_2$ values. Ordering increases U first, then V, then W.
///
/// - [`Subblocks`](crate::Location::Subblocks) puts attribute values on sub-block centroids.
///   The number and values and their ordering matches the `parents` and `corners` arrays.
///
///   To have attribute values on undivided parent blocks in this mode there must be a sub-block
///   that covers the whole parent block.
